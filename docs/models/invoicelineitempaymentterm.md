# InvoiceLineItemPaymentTerm

When this line falls due relative to the window it covers: `in_advance` at the window's start, `in_arrears` at its end. A metered line is stamped `in_arrears`, because usage is only known once the window closes — but metered rows written before that rule carry `null` and were never backfilled, so do not read a metered line's term as guaranteed. `null` also means the line is not billed on a term of its own: manual, grant-discount and adjustment lines carry no term, and an adjustment instead falls due with the charge it reduces. Treat `null` as an expected value on any line type, not an error.

## Example Usage

```python
from paygentic_sdk.models import InvoiceLineItemPaymentTerm

# Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as UnrecognizedStr
value: InvoiceLineItemPaymentTerm = "in_advance"
```


## Values

This is an open enum. Unrecognized values will not fail type checks.

- `"in_advance"`
- `"in_arrears"`
