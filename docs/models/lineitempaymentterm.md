# LineItemPaymentTerm

When the line falls due relative to the window it covers. A fee line carries its price's term; a metered line is stamped `in_arrears`, though metered rows predating that rule carry `null`. Manual, grant-discount and adjustment lines are billed on no term of their own and are `null`. `null` is listed in the enum as well as via `nullable` because OpenAPI 3.0 validators check the enum independently — `nullable: true` alone does not admit it, and createLineItem (which always returns null here) was emitting a schema-violating body.

## Example Usage

```python
from paygentic_sdk.models import LineItemPaymentTerm

# Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as UnrecognizedStr
value: LineItemPaymentTerm = "in_advance"
```


## Values

This is an open enum. Unrecognized values will not fail type checks.

- `"in_advance"`
- `"in_arrears"`
