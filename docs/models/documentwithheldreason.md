# DocumentWithheldReason

Why no Paygentic-rendered document exists for this invoice, or null when none was withheld. A tax-registered merchant's document is a compliance artefact, so it is withheld unless the recorded tax reconciles with the provider exactly and the registered issuer identity is complete. Non-null therefore always accompanies pdfSource `tax_provider` or null, and never `paygentic`. Use it to tell a withheld document apart from an invoice the tax provider serves by design — both report pdfSource `tax_provider`, but only a withheld one can be repaired by POST /v2/invoices/{id}/generate-pdf. `tax_unreconciled`: the provider's tax figure was never recorded against this invoice. `issuer_identity_incomplete`: the registered legal name, tax ID or address could not be read. `tax_component_unpriceable`: a recorded tax component carried no presentable amount. `ledger_mismatch`: the recorded tax figures and the invoice's own totals disagree. `tax_provider_disagrees`: the provider re-read its filing and reported a different tax to the one this invoice was charged — terminal, because correcting an issued invoice is a credit note's job, so retrying the repair cannot clear it. New values may be added, so treat an unrecognised one as withheld rather than failing.

## Example Usage

```python
from paygentic_sdk.models import DocumentWithheldReason

# Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as UnrecognizedStr
value: DocumentWithheldReason = "tax_unreconciled"
```


## Values

This is an open enum. Unrecognized values will not fail type checks.

- `"tax_unreconciled"`
- `"issuer_identity_incomplete"`
- `"tax_component_unpriceable"`
- `"ledger_mismatch"`
- `"tax_provider_disagrees"`
