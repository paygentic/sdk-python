# Reason

Coded failure reason. `entitlement_failed` means the entitlement itself could not be created. `grant_mint_failed` means the entitlement was created but its initial metered grant could not be minted; re-running this reconciliation retries the mint. `reset_cycle_misaligned` means the feature grants a credit discount on a reset cycle that is not the window it would be billed on, so re-running cannot succeed until the plan or the price is corrected.

## Example Usage

```python
from paygentic_sdk.models import Reason

# Open enum: unrecognized values are captured as UnrecognizedStr
value: Reason = "entitlement_failed"
```


## Values

This is an open enum. Unrecognized values will not fail type checks.

- `"entitlement_failed"`
- `"grant_mint_failed"`
- `"reset_cycle_misaligned"`
